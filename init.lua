--[[ VOMIT INHERITANCE FIX ]]
-- Vomit material was intended to inherit properties from Green Slime, this fails however because it is designated as a <CellData/> rather than <CellDataChild/>.

for xml in nxml.edit_file("data/materials.xml") do
	for elem in xml:each_of("CellData") do
		if elem.attr._parent then elem.name = "CellDataChild" end
	end
end




--[[ FIX DROPPER BOLT CHARGES ]]
-- Dropper Bolt spell starts with 25/35 charges. This is because of some nonsense where it's custom card entity is shared with Firebolt and Odd Firebolt.

-- I actually don't fully understand this bug that much since it seems reliant on a bizarre system I don't fully understand and don't think I need to.
-- Removing the overrides from the first <Base/> component appears to fix this, I don't know why they're there or if they do anything helpful?
-- It seems to work, if something breaks go pester me and I'll go fix it.
for xml in nxml.edit_file("data/entities/misc/custom_cards/grenade.xml") do
	local base = xml:first_of("Base")
	if base then
		base:clear_children()
	end
end




--[[ FIX TELEKINETIC KICK REMOVAL ]]
-- The Nullifying Altar does not properly strip the player of their telekinetic powers despite removing the perk.

-- Add `telekinetic_kick` tag to all components on the telekinesis entity.
for xml in nxml.edit_file("data/entities/misc/perk_telekinesis.xml") do
	for elem in xml:each_child() do
		local tags = elem.attr._tags or ""
		if #tags > 0 then tags = tags .. ",telekinetic_kick" else tags = "telekinetic_kick" end
		elem.attr._tags = tags
	end
end

-- Remove all components with the `telekinetic_kick` tag.

			for _,component in ipairs(EntityGetAllComponents(entity_who_picked) or {}) do
				if ComponentHasTag(component, "telekinetic_kick") then EntityRemoveComponent(entity_who_picked, component) end
			end]]

--[[ FIX MIST PROJECTILES ]]
-- The Mist spells do not have the `projectile` tag because `tags` is defined on the entity twice. This causes them to not be properly identified by things like StX or shields.

	modifile(mist, [[tags=""]], [[]]) --Remove redundant tags definition.
